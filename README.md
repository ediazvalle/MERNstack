# PirateCrew
<h2>Pirate crew is a website that I made using MERN that is about pirates making their profiles and posting their pirate achievments</h2>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>I learned how to make a MongoDB that saves a users data and make users with it. I learned how to route, stylize, work and connect 
the front-end and the back-end of the servers using MongoDB and JavaScript. In this website I also learned how to make better form and better sytlize the webpage 
with more colors, blocks and text formatting using CSS.</p>

<p>Below is a link to a video demo of the website</p>
